<h1>NodeMCU Smart Cultivator</h1>


IOT is revolutionising the way we operate and conduct our day to day activities. Hydroponics is a field in which cultivation is brought indoor, into controlled environments to maximize growth of the plant.

In this project, I use a microcontroller NodeMCU. The code is written in a .ino file. There are 3 sensors, light sensor to measure the luminousity and Ultrasonic Sensor to measure the water level in the tank and DHT11 sensor to measure the humidity. An LCD display is used to show the data regarding the light and distance in tank. The Light and Pump is controlled using the relay.
